## Important Note

**Before creating an issue**, please note:

mobile-detect is just a kind of "satellite"-project. It uses the RegEx patterns of
[Mobile-Detect](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect) and generates JavaScript source code
based on the code of its "mother"-project.

Missing patterns for particular devices cannot be added in mobile-detect.js,
instead you have to create an issue in [Mobile-Detect](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect).

Please provide the User-Agent string, the manufacturer and the type of device (phone, tablet, tv, bot, ...).

I won't replicate your issue to Mobile-Detect!

It doesn't make any sense to change generated code. I hope you understand.
